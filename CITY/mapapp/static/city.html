            Chennai: The city where the sun doesnâ€™t need an invitation, the beaches are always in fashion,
            and filter coffee flows like Wi-Fi signals! Known for its scorching heat, even the ACs sweat here. 
            Itâ€™s a place where the roads are ruled by autos with "fixed rate" dialogues, and every street corner smells like crispy dosas and sambhar.
            If you're not sweating, you're probably swimming in Marina Beach waves or dancing in the rain that's fashionably late every year! ðŸ˜„
